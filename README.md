tweeker
=======

An msp430 mini synth on the LaunchPad. A 16*1 LCD, two potentiometers and a piezo buzzer complete the electrics. Sound synthesis has always been something I wanted to try. Tweeker is a simple circuit, using only two dials and the LaunchPad push button for control. MIDI over USB is also possible. The LCD displays the current function of the two pots, and the button switches functions of the pots. The pots can be twisted, and pick up control when crossing the set value. Two hands implies two twisty controls, simple.
