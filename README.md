tweeker
=======

An msp430 mini synth on the LaunchPad. A 16*1 LCD, two potentiometers and a piezo buzzer complete the electrics. Sound synthesis has always been something I wanted to try. Tweeker is a simple circuit, using only two dials and the LaunchPad push button for control. MIDI over USB is also possible. The LCD displays the current function of the two pots, and the button switches functions of the pots. The pots can be twisted, and pick up control when crossing the set value. Two hands implies two twisty controls, simple.

Control Scope
=============

The control pair can be switched between the following pairs of controls. No further control pairs will be developed in this synth. The order of the pairs are linked with the software creation order.

  * VOLUME CONTRAST
  * PITCH TEMPO
  * SUB SUPER
  * REMOD BRIGHT
  * FILT RES
  * PENV FENV
  * WOBBLE TICK
  * note number and value for pattern
  * VERGE EVENS
  * LOGID EXPID
  * GENRIC SPREAD
